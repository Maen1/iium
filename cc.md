# Computation and complexity

## DFA

 * Need to check all input possibility. 
 * We may have a trap state.

## NFA 

* Our concern is the accepted language.
* Using $\lambda$ when we get stuck 🤪.

## Equivalence of DFA and NFA

* Make a table with the all state and input
* Construct the new state output.
* Delete the ones who has no connections with the root.
* BTW you should write the new state with mostach brackets {🐸}.

## Regular Expression

* $ + $ => U
* . => .
* nothing concatinating with anything is nothing 🧐
