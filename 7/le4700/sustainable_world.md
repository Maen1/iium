As computer scientist the best best way to contribute to the sustainable world is through techonology and that can be done in so many ways such as using social media to increase awareness by educating people and show them the right way to have better world. Another way is to build softwares allows machines to conribute as well such as clean water,  firefighter machines  and recycling machines. Furthermore we can organise campaignes  for children to educate how to save the world from the pollution and how to live a green life so the don't do the same mistakes that we did.
