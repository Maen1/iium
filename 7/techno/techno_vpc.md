### Multiple Fits

Some business models work only with a combination of several value propositions and customer segments. In these situations, you require fit between each value proposition and its respective customer segment for the business model to work.

1. Intermediary: 

   When a business sells a product or service through an intermediary, it effectively needs to cater to two customers: the end customer and the intermediary itself. Without a clear value proposition to the intermediary, the offer might not reach the end customer at all, or at least not with the same

   impact.

2. Platforms:

   Platforms function only when two or more actors interact and draw value

   within the same interdependent business model. Platforms are called doublesided

   when there are two such actors and multisided when there are more than

   two. A platform exists only when all sides are present in the model.
