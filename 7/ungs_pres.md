## Intellectual property rights issue (trademarks, patents, copyright and trade secrets).



**Intellectual property** (**IP**) is a category of [property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property) that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The most well-known types are [copyrights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright), [patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent), [trademarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark), and [trade secrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret).

1. Trademark : A [trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark) is a recognizable [sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics)), [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design) or [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(language)) which distinguishes [products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_(economics)) or [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics)) of a particular trader from similar products or services of other traders



2. Patents: A [patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent) is a form of right granted by the government to an inventor or their successor-in-title, giving the owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing an [invention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention) for a limited period of time, in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem, which may be a product or a process and generally has to fulfill three main requirements: it has to be new, not obvious and there needs to be an industrial applicability. To enrich the body of knowledge and stimulate innovation, it is an obligation for patent owners to disclose valuable information about their inventions to the public.
3. Copy rights: A [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) gives the creator of an original work [exclusive rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_right) to it, usually for a limited time. Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or "works". Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed.
4. Trade Secrets: A [trade secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret) is a [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula), practice, process, [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design), instrument, [pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern), or compilation of [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable, by which a [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business) can obtain an economic advantage over competitors and customers. There is no formal government protection granted; each business must take measures to guard its own trade secrets (e.g., Formula of its soft drinks is a trade secret for Coca-Cola.)
