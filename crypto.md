##  controls

 controls are put in place to safeguard any weaknesses in the system and reduce the effect of an attack.

* Deterrent controls: These controls are intended to reduce attacks on a cloud system. Much like a warning sign on a fence or a property, deterrent controls typically reduce the threat level by informing potential attackers that there will be adverse consequences for them if they proceed. (Some consider them a subset of preventive controls).
* Preventive controls: Preventive controls strengthen the system against incidents, generally by reducing if not actually eliminating vulnerabilities. Strong authentication of cloud users, for instance, makes it less likely that unauthorized users can access cloud systems, and more likely that cloud users are positively identified.
* Detective controls: are intended to detect and react appropriately to any incidents that occur. In the event of an attack, a detective control will signal the preventative or corrective controls to address the issue.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_security#cite_note-Krutz,_Ronald_L._2010-8) System and network security monitoring, including intrusion detection and prevention arrangements, are typically employed to detect attacks on cloud systems and the supporting communications infrastructure.
* Corrective controls: reduce the consequences of an incident, normally by limiting the damage. They come into effect during or after an incident. Restoring system backups in order to rebuild a compromised system is an example of a corrective control.

##  privacy

* Identity management: to control access to information and computing resources.
* Physical security: Cloud service providers physically secure the IT hardware (servers, routers, cables etc.) against unauthorized access, interference, theft, fires, floods etc. and ensure that essential supplies (such as electricity) are sufficiently robust to minimize the possibility of disruption. This is normally achieved by serving cloud applications from 'world-class' (i.e. professionally specified, designed, constructed, managed, monitored and maintained) data centers.
* Personnel security:Various information security concerns relating to the IT and other professionals associated with cloud services are typically handled through pre-, para- and post-employment activities such as security screening potential recruits, security awareness and training programs, proactive.
* Privacy: Providers ensure that all critical data (credit card numbers, for example) are masked or encrypted and that only authorized users have access to data in its entirety. Moreover, digital identities and credentials must be protected as should any data that the provider collects or produces about customer activity in the cloud.

## Data security

* Confidentiality: Data confidentiality is the property that data contents are not made available or disclosed to illegal users.
* Access controllability: Access controllability means that a data owner can perform the selective restriction of access to her or his data outsourced to cloud. Legal users can be authorized by the owner to access the data, while others can not access it without permissions.
* Integrity: Data integrity demands maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data. A data owner always expects that her or his data in a cloud can be stored correctly and trustworthily. It means that the data should not be illegally tampered, improperly modified, deliberately deleted, or maliciously fabricated

## Encryption

* Attribute-based encryption (ABE):  type of public-key encryption in which the secret key of a user and the ciphertext are dependent upon attributes (e.g. the country in which he lives, or the kind of subscription he has). In such a system, the decryption of a ciphertext is possible only if the set of attributes of the user key matches the attributes of the ciphertext.
* Ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE): In the CP-ABE, the encryptor controls access strategy. The main research work of CP-ABE is focused on the design of the access structure.

* Key-policy ABE (KP-ABE): In the KP-ABE, attribute sets are used to describe the encrypted texts and the private keys are associated to specified policy that users will have.
* Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE): Fully homomorphic encryption allows computations on encrypted data, and also allows computing sum and product for the encrypted data without decryption.
* Searchable encryption (SE): Searchable encryption is a cryptographic system which offer secure search functions over encrypted data. SE schemes can be classified into two categories: SE based on secret-key (or symmetric-key) cryptography, and SE based on public-key cryptography. In order to improve search efficiency, symmetric-key SE generally builds keyword indexes to answer user queries.
