## 4. Evaluation

Google keyboard mechanism to facilitate entry of emoji

* list of recently used emojy 

* last used page by category.

  

### 4.1 Challenges when testing emoji keyboards

* Problems:
  * the number of emojis is 845  (lv 1 emo)  
  * testing the most common ones, can bias the results.
  * Longitudial study:
    *  chatting behaviour: only small number of emoji are being typed 
    * emojys being typed  are dependent with user mode.
* Solution:
  * Game foramt that allows for control of the task, while still engaging users.
* Chosing data approach:
  * 10 k tweets contain emoji present on google keyboard (822) emoji.
  * keep only emoji and store how often they occured
    * 502 different emoji
  * log transform the emoji frequency to boot the likelihood for rare appearing emoji.



### 4.2 Participants

* 12 participant between 21-41.
* ask the participant whether they often use emoji on their phones on a five-point likert scale:
  * 1:  strongly disagree.
  * 4:  agreed.
  * 3: strongly agreed.
  * 4: didn't lean either way.

### 4.3 Procedure

* participant we given time to try out the google keyboard before the experiment.
* participant were shown emoji to enter that are not part of evaluation set.
* reset google keyboard category state.
* after entering 10 emoji, the paricipant consederd to be sufficiently familiar with the interface.
* if participant more than 1 minuite to find an emoji the trail will be aborted. long seach time frustrated the participants.

### 5.4 Results

* over all performance is adequate.
* users miss the emoji 19% of the time
* 16% of the trials jump to a different category more than twice
