# Cryptography



###  Part B

1. Diffusion and confusion with example:

   Confusion: an encryption operation where the relationship between **key** and **ciphertext** is obscured. (substitution )

   Diffusion: an encryption  opeartion where the influnce of one **plaintext** symbol is spread over many ciphertext, the goal is hiding statical properties of the plaintext.  (bit permutation)

   111001   >> block cipher >> 101010

   101001   >> block cipher >> 000100
