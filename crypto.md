## security controls

 controls are put in place to safeguard any weaknesses in the system and reduce the effect of an attack.

* Deterrent controls: These controls are intended to reduce attacks on a cloud system. Much like a warning sign on a fence or a property, deterrent controls typically reduce the threat level by informing potential attackers that there will be adverse consequences for them if they proceed. (Some consider them a subset of preventive controls).
* Preventive controls: Preventive controls strengthen the system against incidents, generally by reducing if not actually eliminating vulnerabilities. Strong authentication of cloud users, for instance, makes it less likely that unauthorized users can access cloud systems, and more likely that cloud users are positively identified.
* Detective controls: are intended to detect and react appropriately to any incidents that occur. In the event of an attack, a detective control will signal the preventative or corrective controls to address the issue.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_security#cite_note-Krutz,_Ronald_L._2010-8) System and network security monitoring, including intrusion detection and prevention arrangements, are typically employed to detect attacks on cloud systems and the supporting communications infrastructure.
* Corrective controls: reduce the consequences of an incident, normally by limiting the damage. They come into effect during or after an incident. Restoring system backups in order to rebuild a compromised system is an example of a corrective control.

## Security and privacy

* Identity management: Every enterprise will have its own identity management system to control access to information and computing resources.
