        \section{Background}
        \paragraph{}
        Communication is a process of sending and receiving information among people. 
        Humans communicate with others by alot of ways but the most effective way is  face-to-face communication, 
        Many people believe that the significance of communication is like the importance of breathing. 
        Indeed, communication facilitates the spread of knowledge and forms relationships between people.
    
        Deep learning added a huge boost to the already rapidly developing field of computer vision.
        With deep learning, a lot of new applications of computer vision techniques have been introduced and are now becoming parts of our everyday lives.
    
        along side with  the power of todays computers, there are now various algorithms that were developed to enable a
        computers to perform tasks such as object tracking and pattern recognition. 
        
        In this study, the focus will be on hand gestures detection and live tracking. 
        \section{Problem Statement}
        \paragraph{}
        The communication between disabled and other people is
        a really huge gab need to be filled up.
        In order to overcome this challenge many researches and products have been developed to solve these problem, 
        but there is a lot to be enhanced.
        
        \section{Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item To construct a hand gesture to voice model.
            \item To introduce a new hand gesture into voice algorithm.
            \item To test the performance of the system.
        \end{itemize}
